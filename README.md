<h2 align="center">Welcome!~</h2>

Currently, I'm working on wrapping up my undergraduate Computer Science degree. That and a bunch of evergrowing [backlogged games](https://howlongtobeat.com/user.php?n=airi_14x), [anime](https://anilist.co/user/airi14x/), fanfictions and [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69873775-airi-chow). This how my [Software Developer Journey](https://airi-14x.github.io/projects) and my [Language Studies Journey](https://airi-14x.github.io/languages) looks so far! I'm looking to improve my skills in mainly these technologies: Ruby on Rails, Python and JavaScript. Aside from this, I have worked mainly with Java for university and Scala & Python for my internships.

My upcoming focus on the side is Ruby on Rails to contribute to [Archive of Our Own](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive) and to brush up on some Javascript by following TOP's NodeJS curriculum. 

I also wrote a guide for [Concordia's Computer Science and Engineering Students](https://airi-14x.github.io/Concordia-Master-Guide/). It is still being updated but it should be finalised by the end of 2020.
