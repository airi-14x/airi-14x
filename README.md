### Welcome!~

Currently, I'm working on wrapping up my undergraduate Computer Science degree. That and a bunch of backlogged games, anime, fanfictions and books that seem to keep on growing. This how my [Software Developer Journey](https://airi-14x.github.io/projects) looks so far. I'm looking to improve my skills in mainly these technologies: Ruby on Rails, Python and JavaScript.

My focus at the moment is Ruby on Rails in order to contribute to [Archive of Our Own](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive). But, I also wish to explore the world of JavaScript so I'm checking out some NodeJS too.
