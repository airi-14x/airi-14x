<h2 align="center">Welcome!~</h2>

Now that my Undergraduate Computer Science's journey has reached its final act, it's time for me to start a new chapter as a Junior Software Developer! Time to see how this all unfolds in 2021. I'm currently a French & Japanese Language Student at l'Universit√© de Montr√©al!

This how my [Software Developer Journey](https://airi-14x.github.io/projects) and my [Language Studies Journey](https://airi-14x.github.io/languages) looks so far! I'll be honing my skills in mainly these technologies: Ruby on Rails, Python and JavaScript. Aside from this, I have worked mainly with Java for university and Scala & Python for my internships.

When it comes to hobbies not related to coding, you can find me enjoying my evergrowing [backlogged games](https://howlongtobeat.com/user.php?n=airi_14x), [anime](https://anilist.co/user/airi14x/), fanfictions and [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69873775-airi-chow).

I look forward to all of 2021's adventures and I hope the best for everyone's 2021 endeavours as well!~
