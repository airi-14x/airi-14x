<h2 align="center">Welcome!~</h2>

Now that my Undergraduate Computer Science's journey has reached its final act, it's time for me to start a new chapter as a Junior Software Developer! Time to see how this all unfolds in 2021. I'm currently a French & Japanese Language Student at l'Universit√© de Montr√©al!

This how my [Software Developer Journey](https://airi-14x.github.io/projects) and my [Language Studies Journey](https://airi-14x.github.io/languages) looks so far! I'll be honing my skills in mainly these technologies: Ruby on Rails, Python and JavaScript. Aside from this, I have worked mainly with Java for university and Scala & Python for my internships.

My current Winter '21 focus is to work through [Udemy React's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). Following that, my focuses would be on Ruby on Rails by following TOP's advanced Ruby on Rails curriculum with the goal to contribute to [Archive of Our Own](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive) and to hone my Javascript skill by following TOP's NodeJS curriculum. On a side note whilst wrapping up my undergraduate degree, I also got around to finalise a guide for [Concordia's Computer Science and Engineering Students](https://airi-14x.github.io/Concordia-Master-Guide/).

When it comes to hobbies not related to coding, you can find me enjoying my evergrowing [backlogged games](https://howlongtobeat.com/user.php?n=airi_14x), [anime](https://anilist.co/user/airi14x/), fanfictions and [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69873775-airi-chow).

I look forward to all of 2021's adventures and I hope the best for everyone's 2021 endeavours as well!~
